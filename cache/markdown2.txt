# Image Downloader Design Document

## Program Overview
The "image_downloader" program is a command line tool that downloads jpeg images from a series of web pages. It starts with the URL of the first web page and iterates through subsequent pages by following the hyperlink labeled with "Next Link" until there are no more pages in the series.

## Public Functions
The program will have the following public functions:

### 1. `download_images(url: str) -> None`
   - This function takes the URL of the first web page as input.
   - It iterates through the series of web pages, finds the jpeg images, and downloads them.
   - It handles relative paths for image URLs and finds the correct URL.

### 2. `find_next_page_url(page_content: str) -> Optional[str]`
   - This function takes the HTML content of a web page as input.
   - It searches for the hyperlink labeled with "Next Link" and returns the URL of the next page in the series, if found.
   - If no "Next Link" is found, it returns None.

## Shebang
The program will start with a shebang to specify the interpreter to be used when the script is run.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

## Additional Considerations
- The program will use the `requests` library to fetch web pages and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse HTML content and extract image URLs.
- Error handling will be implemented to handle cases such as invalid URLs, missing "Next Link", and failed image downloads.
- Proper logging will be added to track the progress and any errors encountered during the image downloading process.

This design document outlines the high-level structure and functionality of the "image_downloader" program. Detailed implementation of the public functions will be provided in the code.
