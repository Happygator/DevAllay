A program that would download jpeg images from a series of web pages.
The URL to the image might be using relative path, the program should be able to find the correct URL.
The input is the URL of the first web page. The subsequent pages can be found by following the hyperlink labeled with "Next Link".
The program should iterate to all pages in the series until there is no more.

The code will be used as a command line tool called "image_downloader",  so proper shebang should be added.
